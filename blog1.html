    <h1>How I Started My Web Development Journey</h1>
    <p>
      My journey into web development started during my second year of engineering. I came across a tutorial on building a website using HTML and CSS, and I was instantly hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began by building simple websites, experimenting with layouts and styles, and later explored JavaScript to add interactivity. Eventually, I discovered frameworks like React and started building real-world projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey not only helped me discover my passion but also taught me the power of learning by doing.
